  /* 
  * Manas Sanjay may start righting his two methods runByCategroy() and run by Priority() from here. 
  * The guideline to avoid merge conflicts is as follows-
  * The spacing must follow a tab being two spaces otherwise identation may get messy with tabs + spaces combination.
  * If one is using file editor gedit, then tab width has to be 2 spaces with use spaces option enabled. 
  * Please don't edit anything beyond the space alloted to you otherwise we might get into a messy merge conflict.
  * 
  * For your two methods and their javadocs, 90 lines of code space(line no 38 - line no 127) is alloted to you. 
  * In case A) you need more lines to be alloted or B) there is any need to make some changes outside the alloted space, 
  * A pull request has to be made on my branch.
  * I'll merge your branch and A) modify my branch to make requested changes or B) give some more lines of code space in my branch. 
  * You need to then fetch my branch and again make a pull request on my branch for final merge.
